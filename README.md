# W7-SQL-Retirement_Analysis

## Overview 
The goal of this analysis was to examine the employment data for a fictious large enterprise company, Pewlett-Hackard. In this project, I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
When conducting an evaulation of the number of retiring employees, I found that that the term 'silver tsunami' is appropriate given the number of employees retiring in the coming years.  As shown by the chart below, just over 90K employees are likely to retire.

As part of this analysis, I also examined the employees that could potentially participate in a mentorship program to train new employees to fill the positions vacated by retiring employees.

### Through my analysis I found that:
- The largest group of employees that will be retiring are 'Senior Engineers'
- Over 90K employees are likely to retire in the next few years
- Employees in the potential mentoring group have similar titles 'ie. the highest percentage are also Senior Engineers'
- There are significantly more employees retiring than eligible to be mentored

## Summary
In conclusion, I found that Pewlett-Hackard should be thinking ahead about how to address the upcoming wave of retirements but as currently structured, the pool of internal talent is insufficient to meet the demand for leadership moving forward. There are a few ways the analysis could be improved to better account for what positions could be filled and better address this potential tsunami. 

1. The pool of mentorship candidates could be expanded to include younger employees
2. The first analysis should be adjusted to account for current employees only (the setup for this project ignores this element) to better understand how many employees will actually be retiring)
3. A secondary analysis could be conducted to understand the breakdown of retirements by department to address key areas of the business first when considering new hires
