# W7-SQL-Retirement_Analysis

## Overview 
The goal of this analysis was to examine the employment data for a fictious large enterprise company, Pewlett-Hackard. In this project, I determined the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
When conducting an evaulation of the number of retiring employees, I found that that the term 'silver tsunami' is appropriate given the number of employees retiring in the coming years.  As shown by the chart below, just over 90K employees are likely to retire.

As part of this analysis, I also examined the employees that could potentially participate in a mentorship program to train new employees to fill the positions vacated by retiring employees. 





Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
